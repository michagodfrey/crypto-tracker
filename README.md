#### Tutorials that helped

To get started [this tutorial by Brian Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ohK7CapmIs&t) helped give me the refresher I needed on getting data from APIs.

[Roadside Coder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA6oTpMZp84)'s tutorial and repo helped me implement the more complex components of the app and was also the inspiration for the overall layout.

I also studied the repo from the turorial by [Code Commerce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxXw-M5lDOw&t) to implement some of the features in this project.

To make the pagination component I followed this tutorial by [PedroTech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HANSMtDy508).

The examples Chart-js 2 at [Educative](<https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-use-chartjs-to-create-charts-in-react>) helped me figure out to to display a chart in this app.
