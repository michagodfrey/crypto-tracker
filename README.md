# To the Moon Crypto Tracker

This is a cryptocurrency price tracking app. It displays the price data for the top 200 cryptocurrencies as ranked by [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/).

The data comes from [CoinGecko's public API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) hosts the web app.

## Front-end

The homepage displays a list of 200 cryptocurrencies starting with the largest market cap. The list shows rank, price and recent price changes. Each cryptocurrency page has more details including a historical price chart and description.

## Back-end

Users can sign in with email or Google using services offered by [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). An account allows the users to save favorites between sessions.

### Built with

#### React

I used the React framework to build the frontend of this project. It has the following dependencies:

- axios
- react-router-dom
- react-paginate
- chart.js
- reactchartjs-2
- react-alice-carousel
- dompurify
- date-fns
- react-icons

#### Firebase

I used Firebase for hosting and back-end services. Firebase Authorization and Firestore allow users to save their favorties between sessions.

#### Style

Styling was done with a custom CSS stylesheet and included the normalize stylesheet.

### Useful resources

I always wanted to build a crypto price app using data and built this app myself from scratch. Along the way I viewed tutorials to workout how to make specific components and features.

#### Tutorials that helped

To get started this tutorial by [Brian Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ohK7CapmIs&t) helped give me the refresher I needed on getting data from APIs.

[Roadside Coder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA6oTpMZp84)'s tutorial and repo helped me implement the more complex components of the app and was also the inspiration for the overall layout.

I also studied the repo from the turorial by [Code Commerce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxXw-M5lDOw&t) to implement some of the features in this project.

To make the pagination component I followed this tutorial by [PedroTech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HANSMtDy508).

The examples Chart-js 2 at [Educative](<https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-use-chartjs-to-create-charts-in-react>) helped me figure out to to display a chart in this app.

Firebase Auth and Firestore functions were created with help from tutorials by [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aN1LnNq4z54&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jUPIes_B8vRjn1_GaplOPQ&index=2) and Google authentication by [PedroTech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDT7EnUpEoo&list=RDCMUC8S4rDRZn6Z_StJ-hh7ph8g&index=3) and email authentication also by [PedroTech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bXhf_TELP4&list=RDCMUC8S4rDRZn6Z_StJ-hh7ph8g)
